# Collatz-Conjecture
This project is about writing python program to find the collatz conjecture, its maximum value and maximum length in the given range of number using python.
Task 1 is about building collatz sequence
Task 2 is about finding max length of a number in the given range of collatz sequence.For example, maxLength(10) returns numbers 20 and 9 which means that among the numbers 1, 2, 3,…, 10, nine has the longest Collatz sequence, and its length is equal to 20.
Task 3 is about finding max value of a number in the given range of collatz sequence. For example, maxValue(10)returns the numbers 52 and 7 which means that among the numbers 1, 2, 3,…, 10, seven has the largest maximal number in its Collatz sequence, and that number is 52.
